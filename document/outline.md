Things to say in the paper:
- **Introduction**:
  - [ ] What independent evidence is there that S68N is part of the cloud? (maybe for introduction?)
- **Observations**:
  - [x] Description of Keck NIRSPEC data
- **Methodology**:  
  - [x] Composite spectrum forward model and assumptions:  
    - Phoenix model for photosphere
    - Temperature range.
    - Disk veiling is black body
    - Geometrical assumptions and solid angle
    - Reddening and extinction with uncertain slope
    - No line emission
    - No accretion
    - No binary
    - No non-thermal emission
    - Single temperature black body for dust
    - Nuisance parameters-- correlated residual spectrum
    - No pixel-to-pixel variance available, assume S/N = 30
    - Motivation for priors / empirical Bayes / Physics
  - [x] Basic MCMC stuff
- **Results**: from spectral inference
  - [x] Low gravity
  - [ ] Solid angle ratio
  - [ ] High extinction
  - [x] Reasonable Effective Temperature
  - [ ] No preferred BB temperature
  - [ ] No preferred reddening power law
  - [x] Comparison to evolutionary models
  - [x] Comparison to data from IN-SYNC and Doppmann et al.
  - [ ] Equilibrium temperature of a dust grain / simplistic ring model
- **Discussion**:
  - [x] Limitations of the assumptions
  - [ ] Extra correlated noise source?
  - [ ] Robustness of the results in the face of limitations
  - [ ] Forward model of observations with JWST?
- **Appendix**:
  - [ ] Modifications to inference framework
- **Tables**:
  - [ ] List of model parameters and their interpretation
  - [ ] *(deprecated)*: List of experiments
  - [ ] List of median and 16th-84th percentiles of marginal distributions
  - [ ] etc.

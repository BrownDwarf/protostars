Things to say in the paper:

- **Methodology**:  
  - Composite spectrum forward model and assumptions:  
    - Phoenix model for photosphere
    - Temperature range.
    - Disk veiling is black body
    - Geometrical assumptions and solid angle
    - Reddening and extinction with uncertain slope
    - No line emission
    - No accretion
    - No binary
    - No non-thermal emission
    - Single temperature black body for dust
    - Nuisance parameters-- correlated residual spectrum
    - No pixel-to-pixel variance available, assume S/N = 30
    - Motivation for priors / empirical Bayes / Physics
  - Basic MCMC stuff
- **Results**: from spectral inference
  - Low gravity
  - Solid angle ratio
  - High extinction
  - Reasonable Effective Temperature
  - No preferred BB temperature
  - No preferred reddening power law
  - Comparison to evolutionary models
  - Comparison to data from IN-SYNC and Doppman et al.
- **Discussion**:
  - Limitations of the assumptions
  - What independent evidence is there that S68N is part of the cloud?
  - Robustness of the results in the face of limitations
  - Forward model of observations with JWST?

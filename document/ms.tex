\section{Observations}
The observations of S68N were carried out with NIRSPEC on the Keck telescope over 5 epochs from 2003-2014.  The \texttt{NIRSPEC-7} filter provided 1.84$-$2.63 $\mu$m wavelength range, with native spectral resolution of $R=1250$ from a 0\farcs76 (4 pixels) $\times$ 42\farcs0 slit.  
The individual epochs were coadded to form a single composite spectrum of signal to noise ratio $S/N\sim30$.  

\section{Method}

Our approach involves Bayesian forward modeling of the observed spectrum under a range of different assumptions about the protostellar system.  We discuss the limitations of our assumptions in the discussion section.

\subsection{Composite spectrum forward model}

We assume that stellar photosphere and warm circumstellar disk emission dominate the radiation in the near-IR $K-$band.  We constructed a forward model for the observed Keck spectrum using the spectral inference framework \texttt{Starfish} from \citet{czekala15} with support for mixture model modifications from \citet{2017ApJ...836..200G}.  The mixture model for S68N's Keck spectrum is:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:mix_M}
	S_{\mathrm{mix}} = \Omega_{\mathrm{\star}} B(\teffa)  + \Omega_{\mathrm{d}} B(\teffb)
\end{eqnarray}
where $B(T)$ is the spectral radiance as a function of temperature.  The ratio of solid angles relates the relative size of the emission regions:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:fill_factor}
	\frac{\Omega_d}{\Omega_\star} = \frac{r_d^2 d^2}{r_\star^2 d^2} = \frac{r_d^2}{r_\star^2}
\end{eqnarray}

approximating the circumstellar disk emission as a face-on circle.  More accurate estimates for the disk emission and geometries could be obtained from rigorous radiative transfer methods \citep[\emph{e.g.}]{2017arXiv170305765R}.  We model the protostellar spectral radiance $B(T_\star)$ with \PHOENIX\ synthetic model spectra possessing an unknown-but-low surface gravity $\logg \in [2.0,4.0]$ in cm$/$s$^2$ and an effective temperature $\teffa \in [2700,3600]$ K.  The circumstellar disk radiance is assumed to be black body, with a temperature range $\teffb \in [1000,1700]$ K capped by the temperature at which typical dust sublimates.

The radiated spectrum passes through an unknown amount of extinction and scattering, altering its spectral shape in an uncertain---and potentially irretrievable---way.  We explored several options for characterizing the extinction towards S68N.  First, instead of characterizing the spectral slope by a reddening law and extinction, $A_V$, we instead assumed that the overall spectral shape is approximated by a third order polynomial \footnote{The polynomial is parameterized as a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials truncated to the first 3 non-constant terms.}.  The polynomial coefficients lacked interpretability, and may not have adequately approximated extinction power laws, so we also experimented with an $A_K$ and a power law slope:

$$ A_\lambda / A_K = \frac{\lambda}{2.2 \; \mu\mathrm{m}}^{-\alpha}$$

with $\alpha \in [-2, -1.7]$ representing the power law exponent that may depend on dust properties and degree of extinction.  The extinction is then defined as:

$$ 10^{-0.4 A_\lambda}$$

We assume there is zero emission attributable to mass accretion onto the star or disk.  This assumption almost certainly fails for Class 0 protostars, which are still actively accreting a large fraction of their mass.  We see H$_2$ emission lines in the $K-$band spectrum of S68N, so some degree of accretion is likely ongoing, potentially contributing non-negligible veiling in the photospheric absorption lines.  In any case, the limited spectral information available does not permit a more detailed treatment of accretion or disk gas emission as is possible with higher spectral resolution \citep[\emph{e.g.}]{2016ApJ...826..179L}.

 \caption{Pre-main sequence and protostar evolution comparison between theory (left panel) and obseration (right panel).  The 0.02$-$1.2 $M_{\odot}$ evolutionary model tracks are from \citet{baraffe15}, spanning 1 Myr to 100 Myr isochrones; protostars are expected to sit below the 1 Myr isochrone in the region of parameter space demarcated with a yellow dashed ellipse.  The observations show coarse agreement with the models-- measurements of the Pleiades from \citet[green KDE]{cottaar14} cluster around the 100 Myr isochrone, although extend into higher-than-predicted $\log{g}$ for hotter stars.  The younger IC348 sources \citep[purple KDE]{cottaar14} cluster with a large spread above and below the $\sim10$ Myr isochrone.  The source S 68N has a broad posterior PDF (Experiment 4-teal KDE, Experiment 3- red/brown KDE) placing its maximum a-posteriori estimate inside the range of protostars, regardless of experimental assumptions.  The black dots are Class I protostars from \citet{2005AJ....130.1145D}, showing a large range in measured properties with relatively large uncertainties in $\log{g}$.}

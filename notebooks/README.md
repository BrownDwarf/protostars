## Jupyter notebooks

Most of my analyses are in these Jupyter notebooks.

The naming scheme is:

`protostars_` + `issue` + *GitHub Issue Number* `-` *sub-task number* + `_` + A short description + `.ipynb`

I developed this system because any task worthy of a Jupyter notebook is also worthy of a GitHub Issue, which serves as a home for the statement of the problem, and a forum for participants to engage with the problem.


```bash
.
├── protostars_01-01_exploratory_Keck_Archive_metadata.ipynb
├── protostars_01-02_exploratory_Spectral_sampling.ipynb
├── protostars_01-03_exploratory_Save_spectrum_to_HDF5.ipynb
├── protostars_02-01_star_veil_experiment1_MCMC.ipynb
├── protostars_03-01_logg_v_Teff_Doppman_Greene_Covey_Lada.ipynb
└── protostars_04-01_star_BB_experiment2.ipynb
```

Enjoy!
